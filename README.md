## Course Description
Students will explore the neural basis of natural human behavior in real-world contexts (e.g. sports, dance, or everyday activities) by investigating  biomechanics and  neuroscience of human movement, with a focus on the interactions between the perecptual and motor systems in the context of natural tasks and behavior.

 The course will cover philosophical, technological, and scientific aspects related to the study of the neural bases of natural behavior while emphasizing hands on, project based learning. Students will use free open source software, and artificial intelligence/machine learning and computer vision driven tools and methods to record human movement in unconstrained environments.

    
## Course Objectives
- Gain exposure to key concepts related to neural control of human movement.
- Develop a basic understanding of methods and techniques for the recording and analysis of human movement.
- Learn how to use AI/ML tools for research and learning
