# Neural Control of Real-World Human Movement
## 2024 Fall

### Instructor: Jonathan Samir Matthis
### Course Dates: 10 Sept 2024 - 3 Dec 2023
### Course Materials and Resources
- Discord Server (Invite on Canvas) - [TBA]
- Canvas page - [TBA]
- Course website: [TBA]


## Course Description
Students will explore the neural basis of natural human behavior in real-world contexts (e.g. sports, dance, or everyday activities) by investigating  biomechanics and  neuroscience of human movement, with a focus on the interactions between the perecptual and motor systems in the context of natural tasks and behavior.

 The course will cover philosophical, technological, and scientific aspects related to the study of the neural bases of natural behavior while emphasizing hands on, project based learning. Students will use free open source software, and artificial intelligence/machine learning and computer vision driven tools and methods to record human movement in unconstrained environments.

    
## Course Objectives
- Gain exposure to key concepts related to neural control of human movement.
- Develop a basic understanding of methods and techniques for the recording and analysis of human movement.
- Apply interdisciplinary approaches when collaborating on complex problems.
- Contribute effectively within a team setting towards achieving common goals.

## Learning Outcomes
### Design and conduct a research project
- Develop a research plan
- Conduct a literature review
- Compile, analyze, and interpret empirical results
- Present research to a group
