  - What it is
  - How to use it
  
**Assignment** -  Intro chat with bot (follow JKL's format? - generate doc)

## Mocap lab tour
- Intro students to:
    - mocap 
    - eye tracker
    - force plates
- Get freemocap recording of students walking over force plates (parade style)

**Assignment** -  Chat with bot about the experience, in context of previous

## Intro to Space
- SI Units schtick

- Navigating space in Blender
- Look @ data from lab tour
  
**Assignment** -  Look at data and have chat about it w/ bot (generate doc)

## Intro to bodies
- COM, Gait, and Posture
- Kinematics (geometry) vs Kinetics (physics)
- COM vs BOS - theory of gait and balance
- Record 'standard' fmc rec - one foot + jump

**Assignment** -  Look at data and have chat about it w/ bot - focus on mechanics (generate doc)
